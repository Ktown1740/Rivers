    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p> Rivers, in partnership with the city of Florida City, is a transformative initiative with a singular, powerful goal: to end homelessness at its root and restore human dignity. </p>
    <p> Our mission is not limited to offering temporary shelter; instead, we envision a future where individuals once experiencing homelessness are empowered to regain independence, achieve homeownership, and reenter society as fully self-sufficient citizens. We believe in building not just homes, but lives, careers, and futures. </p>
    <p> We see homelessness not just as a lack of shelter, but as a breakdown of support systems, opportunity, and hope. Therefore, our approach is holistic—addressing mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual needs in an environment that reflects care, luxury, and respect. </p>

        <h2>About Rivers</h2>
        <p>
          Rivers is not a typical homeless shelter. It is an architectural and social sanctuary designed with the intention of radically reimagining what transitional housing can be. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The estate will be gated and beautifully landscaped, with a layout reminiscent of White House-style grounds, suggesting order, dignity, and grandeur. The chosen color palette—royal blue, navy, gold, and platinum—invokes a sense of nobility, creating an environment that uplifts rather than diminishes.

        <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Our primary purpose is to get people off the street and end homelessness in Florida City. Beyond immediate shelter, we aim to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Help residents with resume building and obtaining licenses.</li>
          <li>Provide financial services and guidance towards best jobs.</li>
          <li>Offer recreational facilities like a game room and computer room.</li>
          <li>Provide a chapel for spiritual support.</li>
